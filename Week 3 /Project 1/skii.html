    <p>Les Houches is a resort in it's own right just inside the valley on the right when arriving from the southwest (Geneva).
         It is a resort without equal. 360 degree views on the Mont Blanc, good restaurants, good off piste and lots of room for everyone - skiers, boarders, telemarkers, cross-country skiers.

        Pistes runs from 950m to 1900m and lots of tree line skiing - a great area for beginners and intermediates. There are 2 short, 
        gentle beginners slopes at the top of both the Prarion and the Bellevue cable cars (the more gentle and longer of the two is at the top of Bellevue).

        Like Le Tour, Les Houches Ski Resort is a good place for beginners and intermediates, pistes runs from 950m to 1900m and lots of 
        tree line skiing. More sheltered than the other ski areas, it's the place to go when the weather is bad. There are some good fun runs through the trees. 
        There are 2 short, gentle beginners slopes at the top of both the Prarion and the Bellevue cable cars (the more gentle and longer of the two is at the top of Bellevue). There is less off piste but many fun runs through the trees. When there is enough snow, descents can be made on the St Gervais side to a mountain restaurant "La Tanniere" or to St Gervais.
        
        Les Houches has two main cable cars: one leaves from the center of town and climbs to Bellevue, the other from Les Chavants to Le Prarion.
