    <p>A distinctive glass pyramid was added in 1993 as the main entrance and is one of the most distinctive landmarks in France. 
        Its most famous artwork is the Mona Lisa but there are many other treasures that can be admired without the inevitable crowds.
        Leonardo’s Virgin & Child with St. Anne is an arguably better work from the master himself, for example. Look out for Vermeer’s
         The Astronomer, a rare male study from the Dutch master.
        The Venus de Milo is another well-known work, but The Scribe, a haunting Egyptian sculpture from 2,500 BCE 
        is equally impressive. Sleeping Hermaphroditus, a Roman sculpture excavated in 1608, is so finely detailed you can study it for hours.
        
        As for the palace itself, there is much to be seen in its decor. Look out for the Napoleon III apartments on the first floor, 
        and the moat, dungeons—and a model—of that medieval fortress in the basement of the Sully Wing.
