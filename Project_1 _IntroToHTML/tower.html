    <p>The Eiffel Tower was famously built as a temporary structure, its massive arches the entrance to the 1889 World’s Fair.
        That fair marked the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution, but the 1,050-foot-tall tower has survived its 200th as well.
        Now a symbol that Paris is famous for, it’s hard to imagine how unpopular this industrial piece of engineering was at the time. 
        Author Guy de Maupassant supposedly regularly ate lunch here because it was the only place in Paris from where he couldn’t see it.
        <br>
        The first structure to reach 1,000 feet, the Parisian landmark was the world’s tallest for nearly 40 years until briefly overtaken by the Chrysler Building. 
        Its importance as a radio tower ensured its survival after its initial 20-year building license ran out.
        Eiffel’s revolutionary bolted iron construction was predated by the Statue of Liberty framework his firm designed in 1886. 
        He was chosen for his expertise on wind forces, a subject that fascinated him for the rest of his life.
