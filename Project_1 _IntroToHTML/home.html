    <p style="color:darkorchid">
         The Eiffel Tower was famously built as a temporary structure, its massive arches the entrance to the 1889 World’s Fair.  
         That fair marked the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution, but the 1,050-foot-tall tower has survived its 200th as well.
         Now a symbol that Paris is famous for, it’s hard to imagine how unpopular this industrial piece of engineering was at the time. 
         Author Guy de Maupassant supposedly regularly ate lunch here because it was the only place in Paris from where he couldn’t see it

<p style="color:darkorchid" >
    Home to thousands of works of art, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo, this historic museum attracts millions of visitors each year.
One of the best museums in Europe, the Louvre was originally a medieval fortress beside the Seine. 
    Later the royal palace, it was left as the home of the national art collection when Louis XIV moved to the Palace of Versailles.

    <p style="color:darkorchid" >Chamonix, France is often referred to as the "birthplace of mountaineering" because of its rich mountaineering history.
         Nestled at the base of Mont Blanc -- the highest peak in the Alps -- Chamonix has attracted adventurers, climbers and skiers for centuries.
          The resort hosted the first Winter Olympics in 1924 and has been a popular tourist destination ever since.</p>
